# html-practice-project

This is a work on my learning in-depth html journey. I built this site using 95.7% html and 4.3% css. The site is basically html elements, tags, semantics and attributes. I was working with the resources from freecodecamp html for beginners by Dave Gary and ut is a really good one.
